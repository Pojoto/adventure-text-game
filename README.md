# adventure-text-game

###### (Project originally from CS 1024 @ VT, Professor John Lewis)

This fun, small game runs completely on the terminal/output through text. 

You play in first-person, inputting commands into the terminal that perform various actions. By interacting with the game environment, you can progress through the short story in an adventure-style manner.  

Experiment with commands and use clues to figure out how to finish the game... and try not to die.

## To Play

Run __project3.py__ as normal

Start off by taking and reading the info book through:
```
take book
read book
```
This should give you enough information to navigate your way through the rest of the game!
